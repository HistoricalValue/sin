An interpreted language with experimental metaprogramming features.

**NOT MAINTAINED**. This project is not maintained and is frozen in time, in the year 2009. Last known working time was back then. And it did have some issues.

But compilers change and software entropy kicks in, and I suppose this project will have some compilation issues.

This project employs a very unorthodox attitude concerning c++ development. It is before even C++11 became widespread, and there are lots of experimental practices (which ended up being rejected).

To recup, this is a project which is written with bad software practices and is totally unmaintained since 2009. _Why is it here then?_ It is presented here for historical and sentimental reasons, and possible code research.

(This project was originally developed under/over bazaar and is imported from the bazaar repository. The original bazaar history lies still [here](https://code.launchpad.net/~isidev/sin/trunk))
