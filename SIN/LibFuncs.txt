=== LibFuncs ===

- LibFuncs have predefined signatures (probably return_type libfunc(SymbolTable*)).
- Install libfuncs at init
- At func call check if sin func or lib func and do the appropriate actions.


=== How to prepare/call libfuncs ===
- Create a VirtualState (SINVirtualState.h)
- Create a Library, passing the VirtualStete's pointer (SINLibrary.h)
- Create the standard library functions from SINLibraryFunctions.h
- Install them all in the library
- Pass the library to the evaluator.
- Invoke functions with their name through the library's Invoke method.
  Only argument needed is their environment (a stable).
- A libfunc can alter all its arguments (the VirtualState, the SymbolTable
  and the Library itself). Keep that in mind, no temporary instances, etc.
