*[004] Make ASTNode subclasses give an appropriate name to their ASTNode ancestor

*[005] Implement FileOutputStream-s


*[006] Delete AST nodes (some day)
*[007] Add a method DestroyTree() somewhere.

*[008] Add unique ID for each ASTNode
*[009] AST Const nodes give correct string name

---logging---
*[010] LoggerFactory base should internally keep a list of produced loggers
  and validate them at destruction time (make sure the pointers are correct)
*[011] Add a "set all record printers" method to LoggerManager


----- Parser (for santa) -----
*[012] FIX YYPARSE'S ARGUMENTS!!
  - ASTNode *& root   <--- return result in there
*[013] Investigate the parser's auto-destruction callbacks on error and stuff
*[014] Add error querying method in parser





==== QYESTIONS =====
* What about native object pointers? Why are they needed for the AST?

==== LOW PRIORITY ====
* SIN Functors
* "compile time" Warnings





===== DONE ====
*[001] Rename SinParserTester.h
  [ rudolf| has the correct name already]
*[002] SIN::Tests::Test::nextTestName() : fix static member initialisation
  [ rudolf| introduced class TestFactory]
*[003] Add default severity in LoggingManager
  [ rudolf| default severity property added (along with much refactoring again)]
