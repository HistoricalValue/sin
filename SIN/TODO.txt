==== Always in mind ====
* check dynamic_castss

==== Do once ====



*[032] Make following lib funcs.
		tostrin, strtonum, strsavetofile, typeof, input, print, println, openfile, closefile, writefile,
		readfile, totalarguments, arguments, objectcopy
		
*[033] Make manage functions for the fllowing rules:
		1) DOT '~'	'(' expr ')'
		2) DOT '~' call
		3) lvalue DOT KEYS_MEMBER
		4) lvalue DOT SIZE_MEMBER
		5) ',' objectfuncdef objectlists
		6) {
			objectfuncdef:	FUNCTION ID	'(' idlist ')' block
							|	FUNCTION '(' idlist ')' block
		}


*[040 2009-08-27/01:47] Check and make a correct the default and ESPECIALLY copy constructor AND destructor for the SymbolTable (koutsop only)


*[042 2009-08-27/18:12] Implement all kinds of binary operations among all types of memory cells (yeah, hahah).

*[043 2009-08-28/11:22] SINAlloc should call destructors on array members on delete[]

*[045 2009-08-28/14:37] Make libfuncs use the environment return value pointer and remove the return value stuff from the virtual state.

*[046 2009-08-30/21:13] Make use of deprecated functions be logged


*[026] Make the testing framework serious (save results and print them later -- especially TestCollections should be serious)
*[027] Default ctor of LamdaFunctionASTNode should name automatically the node with $lamdaxxx

---logging---
*[010] LoggerFactory base should internally keep a list of produced loggers
  and validate them at destruction time (make sure the pointers are correct)
*[011] Add a "set all record printers" method to LoggerManager


----- Parser -----



==== QUESTIONS =====
* What about native object pointers? Why are they needed for the AST?
  A: AST pointers are fine
* What is the purpose of .~?
  A: For completeness
* What about extensible library functions? How can we add library functions?
  A: By adding code

==== BIG PLANS ====
* [DONE} Refactor Manage funcs to use the correct Tree

==== LOW PRIORITY ====
* SIN Functors
* [043 2009-08-28/02:03] Add "SymbolID()" in ID AST Nodes and keep their Name property descriptive (ex "local a")


===== IGNORED =====
*[020] Fix ASTNodes (the whole template inheritance style is bad)
